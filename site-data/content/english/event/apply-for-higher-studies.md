### About Event

After completing graduation, a large number of our students desire to pursue higher studies abroad. But lack of proper guidelines and sufficient knowledge may come in the way of fulfilling our dreams. So, when the time comes to finally turn our applications in, we may regret a bit about not being aware of getting accustomed to the process earlier. It may get difficult for us to keep the necessary documents in hand within the deadline.

Keeping this thought in mind, in the webinar IEEE BUET CS SB arranged a live talk to hear from two fresh graduates Syeda Nahida Akter Tisha & Sazan Mahbub. They told us how to equip ourselves with prior knowledge to prepare for higher studies abroad beforehand! This webinar helped everyone follow their guidelines and suggestions to make impeccable applications.
