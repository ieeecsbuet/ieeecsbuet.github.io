### About Event

We have successfully organized the event titled "𝟏𝟑 𝐰𝐚𝐲𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐟𝐚𝐢𝐥 𝐢𝐧 𝐚 𝐬𝐨𝐟𝐭𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰". We are overwhelmed by the response from students of all batches. Thanks to 𝐌𝐝 𝐈𝐦𝐫𝐚𝐧 𝐇𝐚𝐬𝐚𝐧 𝐇𝐢𝐫𝐚 vai and 𝐌𝐝. 𝐄𝐧𝐳𝐚𝐦 𝐇𝐨𝐬𝐬𝐚𝐢𝐧 vai for sharing their valuable time with us and giving us some insights on the interview process of the big tech companies.
Here are some glimpses of the session.
